## Activity 3: Reflection

### 1. What design choices did you make (colors, fonts, layout)?

I used ConstraintLayout for an efficient and responsive design. The content is centered both horizontally and vertically, adhering to the Alignment principle. I applied Proximity by minimizing spacing between related elements (Name/Bio). I used Material Design-based styles for Consistency and ensured high Contrast.

### 2. How did you ensure the screen is user-friendly and accessible?

I ensured high Color Contrast and used sp units for text sizes to support dynamic scaling, which is critical for Accessibility. I included an android:contentDescription on the ImageView so it's recognized by screen readers like TalkBack. The layout prioritizes Simplicity and Clarity, making the screen intuitive and usable.

### 3. What would you improve if this were a real app?

I would implement Dark Mode support and use a CardView to apply Material Design principles. I would add Meaningful Motion to buttons for clear Feedback. Finally, I would create an optimized layout-land file to ensure better Responsiveness in landscape mode.
